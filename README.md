Project Chosen: The Daley-Kendall model 

Overview
* Population Categories:
  - Susceptible (S): Individuals who have not yet heard the rumor.
  - Informed (I): Individuals who have heard the rumor and can potentially spread it.
  - Spreaders (R): Individuals who actively spread the rumor to others. This category is often interchangeable with or part of the Informed category, depending on the specific model variation.

* Basic Assumptions:
  - The population is finite and fixed in size.
  - Each individual can be in only one of the categories at a given time.
  - The spreading process follows certain probabilistic rules.

* Model Dynamics:
  - Transmission: Susceptible individuals can become Informed through interactions with Informed individuals. The rate at which this happens is often modeled as a probability per unit of time or based on contact rates.
  - Spreading Rate: The rate at which Informed individuals spread the rumor to Susceptibles is a key parameter in the model. Itâ€™s often denoted as a spreading rate or transmission probability.
  - Recovery: In some variations, Informed individuals might eventually "forget" the rumor or become less likely to spread it. This adds a recovery or forgetting rate to the model.

* Key Features
  - Thresholds: There may be a threshold value of the transmission rate that determines whether the rumor spreads widely or dies out. This is similar to the concept of a threshold in epidemic models.
  - Simulation: In practice, the Daley-Kendall model is often simulated using computational methods to understand how rumors spread under various conditions, such as different network structures or interaction patterns.

* Applications
  - Social Media: The model can be adapted to study how rumors or information spread through social media platforms, where the network of interactions can be quite complex.
  - Marketing: Companies can use the model to simulate how marketing messages or product information spread through a target audience.

By understanding the dynamics of rumor spreading through the Daley-Kendall model, researchers and practitioners can gain insights into the factors that influence the spread of information and potentially develop strategies to manage or influence it.
